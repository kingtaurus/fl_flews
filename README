WHAT IS Fl_flews

    Fl_flews is a set of additional extended widgets for the excellent 
    FLTK library.
    
    This library contains the following widgets:
    
    Fl_Value_Slider_Input : Similar to the Fl_Value_Slider widget
                            with an added editable text field.

    Fl_Value_Input_Spin :   Same functionality as the Fl_Value_Input widget
                            extended with spin buttons and full editable input.					    
    Fl_Spin :               A Spin button widget.
    
    Fl_Ball :               A 3D ball widget, Works as a virtual trackball,
                            it's similar to the rotate widget of GLUI(see below)
			    but doesn't requires a 3D library (it uses the
                            included Fl_Quaternion class for calculating the
                            ball orientation)
			    
    Fl_Multi_Value_Slider:  A special kind of slider composed of multiple
                            segments (i.e.: like the ones used to edit
                            color gradients in most graphical applications) 
   
    Fl_Pack_2D:             A widget that works like the Fl_Pack widget but can
                            have more than one column/row of widgets, is
                            very useful for implementing icon toolbars.

Flews also contains the following helper functions and classes:

   gl_image:                Converts an FLTK shared image Fl_Image into an 
                            openGL texture, works the same way as glTexImage
                            and converts all registered image formats of FLTK 
                            into whatever internal ogl format you want.

   Fl_Quaternion:           Quaternion handling class, allows conversions 
                            from/to vector-angle, matrix, euler. 

   fl_trackball:            includes a trackball implementation, uses the
                            Fl_Quaternion class (defined on the same file as the
                            quaternion class).
   
   fl_rotMatrixToEuler:     Receives a 4x4 rotation matrix and converts it to a
                            set of euler angles (around axis (x,y,z)).

    GLUI is not required for flews the link is here just for reference of the
    original idea of a ball widget.
