If you have everything installed in the default directories, then you
can so this at a shell prompt:

   ./configure
   make

This will create the libflews.a library and the testflews demo program.

To use this library you can simply use the libflews.a library or add the 
specific widgets source files you want to use to your proyects.

The current widgets in the library (v0.3.1) work exactly in the same way
as the corresponding default widgets, only now you can either edit the text in
the valuator or have and extended interaction features. see the testflews demo 
program for an example.
